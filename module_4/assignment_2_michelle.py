Module 4 Assignment 3: String formatting

Begin by executing this script from the command line by typing
    `$ python assignment.py`


This script will print out all the questions and the returned value. This
script must execute without error.

Each question is a fill-in-the-blank and ends with a blank
`return` statement. Provide the answer to the question following
the return statement.

Sample question:

    def question():
        '''What is 2 + 2?'''
        return

    Answer:
        return 2 + 2

Note:  Use the system's current time wherever there is mention of
       today's date, or the current time (i.e. .today()). Do not hard
       code the date which you completed the assignment.


Some questions have variables in them, and will need manipulation. In that
case, perform whatever transformations to the variable, and make sure that
it is returned.

Example:
    def question():
        '''Do something to variable x and return.'''
        x = 'a variable'
        ... code that does stuff to x ...
        return x
